TASK 
INTRODUCTION: Factor based legal domains, rely on factors, or stereotypical patterns of fact that tend to strengthen or weaken a legal claim.  In other words, factors are kinds of legally relevant facts that directly support the legal position (argument, conclusion, etc.) of a party.  For example, in trade secret misappropriation cases, disclosing a trade secret in negotiations favors the legal conclusion that no trade secret misappropriation occurred.  Factors also arise in other legal domains.  For example, factors come into play in a determination as to whether an officer had reasonable suspicion to detain a motorist on suspicion of drug trafficking.  Simply put, in this domain, an officer will have stopped someone for a traffic offense, such as speeding, and then the officer, during the course of the stop may notice things that make them suspicions that drug trafficking is occurring.  We will be looking for factors in these cases. 

To identify these factors, we have prompted a large language model (LLM) to analyze cases and produce factor definitions. Here’s a sample of output generated by the LLM: 

**11. Furtive Movements:** Furtive movements by the motorist, such as reaching back into the vehicle after exiting, can contribute to reasonable suspicion.

The name of the definition produced by the model is between the ** characters.  Above the definition name is “Furtive Movements”.  The definition produced by the model is the text to the right of the last **.

The LLM was exposed to the analysis and conclusion of 50 different court opinions, in batches of 10.  Thus, the LLM was prompted with 10 cases, 5 different times.  However, the model was not aware of factors that it identified in a previous iteration.  Thus, the model could have seen the same facts leading to the identification in a factor in different iterations. 
Instructions: It will be your job to review the output of the LLM and its attempt to identify factors and to combine and refine the information returned by the LLM.  The key is to identify factors in such a manner that they have meaningful commonality, but also are meaningfully different from other factors.  There should be a definable boundary between factor definitions, but not so highly defined that each fact that you read is designated as its own factor.  An example from another factor domain is useful.  
Let’s consider the factor Agreed-not-to-disclose from the trade secret domain.  The general fact that this factor covers is that the plaintiff (person claiming trade secret misappropriation) entered into agreement with the defendant (person who misappropriated a trades secret) that the trade secret would be confidential.  This could come up in in a lot of different ways.  Perhaps an explicit contract was signed.  Perhaps there was a verbal agreement and a handshake.  Maybe the agreement was entered into after someone gained access to the trade secret that should not have.  It is key to understand how one kind of factor can be described in many different ways.  If you identified the factors Agreed-not-to-disclose-Formal, Agreed-not-to-disclose-Informal, Agreed-not-to-disclose-Handshake that would be too detailed. 
Let’s consider another factor, Disclosure-in-negotiations, in this instance a person holding a trade secret made a disclosure to someone during negotiations with a defendant. As stated in the prompt, you should notice how this description of the factor is sort of broad, but specific. In specific, it is referencing the disclosure of facts during negotiations. Broadly, a disclosure could happen in negotiation in many ways. Perhaps the disclosure occurred during informal negotiations during a dinner meeting or conversation in an elevator. Perhaps the disclosure occurred during a formal negotiation session. The key component is that a factor needs to cover a specific scenario but be broad enough to encompass how the different ways that scenario may present itself.
Consider these two factors Agreed-not-to-disclose and Disclosure-in-negotiations.  They share some commonalities, but if you grouped them together as something like Disclosure-at-play, that would be too general.  

- BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS - 
1.	You will be provided with a list of factor definition names and definitions. 
2.	Review the LLM output below and group obviously similar factor definitions.  
    2.1.	If two (or more) iterations have different definition names but the same definition, choose the definition name that best fits the definition and tweak it if needed.  If, for instance, one title is “Disclosed Information to Other Party” and the other is “Disclosed While Negotiating” you would modify or pick the best definition name. 
3.	After the obviously similar definitions have been combined, start working to identify more subtle similarities and differences and group the factors together. 
4.	Lastly, look at the language of the factors that you’ve grouped together in a detailed manner and start refining the factor groups by 
    4.1.	Capture and refine redundant language. If two definitions mention the same thing, it only needs to be mentioned once.  For example, if definition one and two mention a blue sky as a factor, it only needs to be mentioned once. 
    4.2     Capture the full breadth of the factor. Consider, for example, that you have a factor “Good Weather Conditions” and the model identifies “The skies are blue.”, “The skies are clear.”, “The grass is green.”, “There is a breeze in the air.” You might tweak this language to “The skies are blue and clear, grass is green, and there is a breeze in the air”.  More than one sentence is ok when doing this.

Things to look out for:
5.	It is possible (and likely) that the model will put information having to do with separate factors under a single definition.  Continuing with the example above having to do with the Agreed-not-to-disclose and Disclosure-in-negotiations. If the model were to return a definition: “Disclosure Factor: Agreements between the parties not to disclose trade secrets and disclosures that may have occurred during negotiations.”  The proper thing to do would be to separate this definition. 
    5.1     For example: If two (or more) definitions have the same title, such as Disclosure-in-negotiations and one definition includes concepts that are not present in other definition, determine whether those concepts are appropriate.  If one definition states: “disclosure of trade secret made during information negotiations” and the other definition states: “disclosure of trade secrets made during negotiations or required employees to sign a non-disclosure agreement”, you would exclude from the definition part of the definition relating to the non-disclosure agreement.
6.	It is possible that because the LLM output has seen only a sample of cases, therefore, a factor returned by the model may validly represent a factor if mentioned only once. 
7. More than 20 factors is too much.
